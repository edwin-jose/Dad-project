# hello-world
A small project for me to test out my newly acquired python knowledge and also to familiarize myself with Github.
I'll update this as I learn more about the proffessional coder/github ettiquette. 
Thanks for reading, and feel free to point out any errors in my noob ways or if you feel like sending some pointers my way.
Cheers.
